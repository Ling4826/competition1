Today the sky is blue like candy.  
The clouds look like cotton candy.  
I walked with my little dog named Bobo.  
He jumped around like a frog.  
Then we saw a big bird flying.  
It could talk!  
"Hello, little one. Do you want to go on an adventure?"  
I laughed and said, "Yes!"  
Then we flew into the sky with my heart going boom boom!
