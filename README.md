## Getting Started with Neetcode 150 in Java

This project is set up for practicing and solving coding problems from the **Neetcode 150** course using Java in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

This workspace provides a basic structure to organize your code:

-   `src`: **The main folder for your source code.** You can create a `.java` file for each problem here, such as `TwoSum.java`, `ContainsDuplicate.java`, etc.
-   `lib`: The folder to maintain dependencies or external libraries (which are typically not required for most problems).

Meanwhile, the compiled output files (`.class` files) will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

For most problems in the Neetcode 150 list, you won't need any external libraries. However, if required, the `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
